The goal of this analysis is to look for correlations between user demographic features and their overall listening. A correctly formatted version of the end report can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/james_kelleher/155526).

Additionally, there is a warmup analysis to determine whether male and female listeners are significantly different in their overall listening. For that, please examine `warmup.Rmd`.
